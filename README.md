# uc-data-structures-in-c
This repository contains C implementations of fundamental data structures, developed as part of a university course on Data Structures during my second year of study. 

The project includes examples and exercises on structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. 

The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of how these structures work under the hood in C.
